Usage
Place your Twitter data CSV file in the same directory as the script. Ensure that the file follows the correct format and includes the required columns.
Open the script file (twitter_type_face_bot3) in a text editor.
Update the filename variable with the name of your CSV file.
Optionally, customize the parameters such as the number of top words to display and the weights for word frequency.
Run the script using Python:

python twitter_type_face_bot3.py
The script will process the Twitter data, print the common trending words, and display three bar charts representing the most repeated words, most liked words, and most retweeted words.
